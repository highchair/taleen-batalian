<img class="artist-image" src="{% link assets/images/taleen-portrait-2025.jpg %}" alt="Portrait of Taleen Batalian" />

Taleen Batalian is an artist and educator working across mediums of textiles, drawing, painting, and printmaking. Her work explores emotional landscapes and ways in which the body can serve as a vehicle for carrying experiences and memories.

Among her recent exhibitions and projects: _Counterpoint_, a two-person exhibition of 2D and 3D artworks exhibited in conversation and contrast with one another (2024); _Tender Cargo_, a solo exhibition and live performance that explored how bodies hold and carry trauma across time and geography. Batalian led a team of collaborators for this multidimensional project which combined her sculptural garments with dance, original sound score, and scenic design (2022); _Waves and Shadows_, a collaborative film (2020); and _Disassemble_, a live performance at RISD Museum (2018).

Taleen has been awarded grants from Rhode Island State Council on the Arts (RISCA), Providence Art, Culture + Tourism (ACT), and The Arts and Cultural Alliance of Newport County. She was named **2020-21 Teacher of Excellence** at Rhode Island School of Design, Continuing Education where she has been a faculty member for more than 16 years. She currently resides in Providence, RI.
