  <p>Titled <em>Graft</em>, this site-specific installation at the Weil Gallery at Wheaton College, was the culmination of more than two years working in multiple disciplines on fiber-based sculptures and encaustic paintings. The exhibition explored the act of pairing disparate pieces together, to discover whether they would “take” and become unified. </p>
