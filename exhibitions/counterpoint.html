  <p>COUNTERPOINT is a collaborative exhibition showcasing the work of Taleen Batalian and Francoise McAree. The show at <a href="https://www.overlapnewport.com/">OVERLAP</a>, features individual pieces by each artist, in conversation and contrast with one another, across a spectrum of materials and techniques including textiles, printmaking, paper-making, sculpture, and painting.</p>

  <p>Presenting the works of two artists together often invites viewers to explore their similarities. However, in the case of COUNTERPOINT it is the differences—whether in scale, materials, process, or content—that sharpen the focus on each individual work. Subtle dissonances emerge, disrupting the narrative, while collectively, the contrasting elements offer an enriched understanding of the artists' shared subjects: the body and skin.</p>
