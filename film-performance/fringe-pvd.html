  <h2 class="h5">Project Description</h2>

  <p>This performance at <a href="https://www.fringepvd.org/index.html" target="_blank" title="Opens a new window">FRINGE PVD</a> served as a window into the larger exhibition and performance of <a href="{% link film-performance/tender-cargo.html %}">Tender Cargo</a> held at WaterFire Arts Center in Fall 2022.</p>

  <p>Artist Taleen Batalian creates sculptural garments — equal parts clothing, sculpture, and emotional albatross – which come to life in a performance by Heidi Henderson with an original sound score by Antonio Forte. Batalian’s garments play out poignant narratives that mine her Armenian history and inherited family trauma and also speak more universally to the legacy of trauma so many of us face. Beautiful and haunting, this work challenges the viewer to consider how and why we carry our heavy loads — inspiring conversation, community and connection around our shared experiences.</p>
