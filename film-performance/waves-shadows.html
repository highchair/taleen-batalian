  <p><em>Waves and Shadows</em> merges Taleen Batalian’s sculptural garments with music, movement, and environment through a collaborative process. Batalian and her collaborators explore the ephemeral and fleeting qualities of waves and shadows as guiding themes of the project. The film’s choreography, score, and scenic design were developed using site-specific aspects, including weather conditions and field recordings, of Beavertail State Park in Jamestown RI. Originally, this project was conceived as a live performance. Postponed due to the pandemic, the project was reimagined as a film. Ultimately, the work, in both of its forms, explores ways to “transport” an audience for a period of time.</p>
