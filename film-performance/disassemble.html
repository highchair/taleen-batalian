  <p>A collaborative performance developed by Taleen Batalian (Artist) and Heidi Henderson (Dancer/Choreographer) explored connections between the inside and outside of the body and reflected ways vulnerability can be both protective and freeing. Batalian’s sculptural garments informed Henderson’s improvised movement in the exhibition <em>The Phantom of Liberty</em>, RISD Museum, October 2018.</p>
