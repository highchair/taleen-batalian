# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values which you are expected to set up once 
# and rarely edit after that. If you find yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use 'bundle exec jekyll serve'.
# If you change this file, restart the server process.

# Site settings
#   These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files, you will see them accessed via 
#   {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on. You can create any custom variable you would like, and they 
#   will be accessible in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
